# The latest version as installed by the Cygwin Setup program can

# Modifying /etc/skel/.mkshrc directly will prevent
# setup from updating it.

# The copy in your home directory (~/.mkshrc) is yours, please
# feel free to customise it to create a shell
# environment to your liking.  If you feel a change
# would be benificial to all, please feel free to send
# a patch to the cygwin mailing list.
